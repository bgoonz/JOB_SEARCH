We’ve had an influx of questions surrounding this topic recently and wanted to share some quick things to check if you’re worried about a potential scam.**10 signs of a scam:**\
**#1 : They ask you to share private information like your SSN, bank account, drivers license number, etc. before going through a formal interview and offer process. #2: The email is coming from a generic domain name (gmail, yahoo, hotmail, etc.) instead of a company domain.#3:** Emails have significant spelling and grammar errors.**#4:** You get offered a job without ever having interviewed, OR you get offered a technical role without demonstrating your abilities via a technical interview or take-home assignment.**#5:** You never speak to anyone directly on the phone, over video, or in person, and/or they conduct interviews over a messaging platform.**#6:** You are asked to pay for training, software, or your own background check or credit report. **#7:** You can’t find any information about the company online, or the website looks fake.**#8:** Vague job descriptions with no real requirements or responsibilities.**#9:** Fake employees from a real company. Compare their contact info to the companies to make sure they match.**#10:** It sounds too good to be true...It probably is!**Other RED FLAGS to watch out for:**\\

* They make you sign a contract and there is a penalty if you leave - we encourage ‘at-will employment’!
* They take a portion of your income during the contract period.

**You can find all of these tips + more in our 1-page document on scams **[**here**](https://www.notion.so/lambdaschool/How-to-tell-if-a-job-is-a-scam-de4837d7e2f640bcb90e73443adef670)** (consider bookmarking this so you can return to it later!).

**Hiring partners have told us that the CodeSignal General Coding Assessment (GCA) is a good proxy for the technical skills they’re looking for. As a result, starting March 15th Lambda is going to be using a minimum score of 650 on the CodeSignal GCA as a requirement for graduates interested in Lambda’s hiring partner opportunities. In reality, the higher your GCA score is the more opportunities we can opt you in for.\_**For prep advice and details about the CodeSignal GCA, \*\*review our CS Lead Instructor Beej Hall’s documentation [_here_](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/CS-Wiki/wiki/CodeSignal-GCA-Info#how-to-practice).\_![:interrobang:](https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1\&o1=gu\&url=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fproduction-standard-emoji-assets%2F13.0%2Fgoogle-medium%2F2049-fe0f%402x.png)**HOW DOES THIS CHANGE AFFECT ME**![:interrobang:](https://slack-imgs.com/?c=1\&o1=gu\&url=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fproduction-standard-emoji-assets%2F13.0%2Fgoogle-medium%2F2049-fe0f%402x.png)\\

* _**I don’t have a GCA score. How do I take the GCA?**_

Use this [link](https://app.codesignal.com/get-certified?invite=TGy6wcugpm4LMFEQX) to sign-up with your lambda school email. You’ll receive results via email after you complete the test and results are forwarded to Lambda.Regardless of your score, you’ll continue to get all the support you’ve received in the job search. Please note that while you’ll also continue to see partner opportunities in job board, only students with GCA scores will move forward. Seeing opportunities in job board keeps you aware of hiring partners, and hopefully encourages you to take the assessment. If you do not receive a 650+ score the first time, you can retry the assessment every 2 weeks. This test can be taken multiple times.

* _**I previously took the CodeSignal GCA and scored below 650.**_

No worries! Study up and retake the [assessment](https://app.codesignal.com/get-certified?invite=TGy6wcugpm4LMFEQX) if it has been longer than 2 weeks.

* _\*\*I’ve taken the CodeSignal GCA and scored 650+. \*\*_

As long as your student profile is complete, and your score has been reported to Lambda, you’ll continue to have access to hiring partner opportunities. If you’re up for it, [retake the test](https://app.codesignal.com/get-certified?invite=TGy6wcugpm4LMFEQX) to see if you score higher.

* _\*\*I don’t want to take CodeSignal GCA. \*\*_

You don’t have to! Work with your careers staff member to find external opportunities. Hiring partner opportunities are meant to supplement your job search. There are many opportunities out there that don’t require a GCA score.

* _**I don’t know my GCA score.**_

You’ll need to go into CodeSignal to see your score(s). When you complete assessments in CodeSignal you receive an email with a link to view scores via the CodeSignal site. Still having difficulty finding it? Ping a careers staff member.
